# CE4201-IoT-ML-Project

An IoT plant monitor project for my CE 4201 IoT class Fall 2021 using a Raspberry Pi 4B. My three partners and I used Python, SQL, Google Cloud, I2C hardware, and OpenCV on this project.

SensorData.py is the script to monitor the plant, upload the data to a local and a Google cloud SQL database, and email the plants owner what the status of it was. 

ML/face_recognition.py detects our faces and displays them onscreen using OpenCV. If we had more time in the course, the goal was to integrate ML face recognition into our IoT plant project.
